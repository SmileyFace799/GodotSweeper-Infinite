# GodotSweeper Infinite
<p>This is a re-make of my "JavaSweeper Infinite" project, which again is a discontinued & unfinished Java re-make of my "Minesweeper Infinite" project, which is quite simply Minesweeper in, but progressively generated & infinite (with large quantities of spaghetti Python code).</p>

## Deadline
<p>The deadline for the MVP of the project is 6/1/2025. Anything outside the MVP will not be prioritized until after this deadline. Beyond the deadline, this will probably become more of a "passion project", where development will happen whenever I feel like it, without any time constraints.</p>

## Goals of this project
<p>The "end goal" of this project is simply infinite Minesweeper, but expanded with some unique features to adapt it into a roguelike. There's a few smaller goals along the way (listed below), which will be checked off as the project develops. More specific goals will be tracked using an issue board.</p>

<p><b>List of goals (within deadline):</b>

    <li>Create a runnable project with core Minesweeper gameplay: ✅</li>
    <li>Create a playable infinite Minesweeper game: ✅</li>
